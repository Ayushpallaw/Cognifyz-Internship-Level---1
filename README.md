## Project Overview
The restaurant dataset contains information such as restaurant IDs, names, cities, countries, and types of cuisines. This project aims to explore, analyze, and visualize the data to gain meaningful insights and make informed recommendations.

## Objectives

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
◉ Identify the number of rows and columns.<br>
◉ Check for missing values and handle them.<br>
◉ Perform data type conversion if necessary.<br>
◉ Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances<br>

### Descriptive Analysis:
◉ Calculate basic statistical measures for numerical columns.<br>
◉ Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code," "City," and "Cuisines."<br>
◉ Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.<br>

### Geospatial Analysis:
◉ Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.<br>
◉ Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.<br>
◉ Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.<br>

## Key Insights

◉ The dataset comprises 9561 rows and 21 columns.<br>
◉ There are 9 missing values in the "Cuisines" column, which have been replaced with "Not Specified."<br>
◉ There are no duplicates in the dataset.<br>
◉ No data type conversion or class balancing is needed.<br>
◉ Most restaurants are in Country Code 1, followed by Country Code 216.<br>
◉ Specifically, Delhi has 5473 restaurants, Gurgaon has 1118, and Noida has 1080.<br>
◉ The most common cuisines are "North Indian," "Chinese," and "Fast Food."<br>
◉ The USA and India have the most restaurants in this dataset.<br>

## Recommendations

### Data Cleaning:
◉ Ensure all missing values, particularly in the "Cuisines" column, are appropriately handled.<br>
◉ Periodically check for new missing values or inconsistencies in the dataset.<br>

### Market Analysis:
◉ Focus marketing efforts on regions with high concentrations of restaurants, like Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida.<br>
◉ Develop strategies to introduce popular cuisines like "North Indian," "Chinese," and "Fast Food" in underrepresented areas.<br>

### Location Strategy:
◉ Use geospatial analysis to identify potential new locations for restaurant expansion based on high-rated areas.<br>
◉ Correlate restaurant ratings with specific locations to understand regional preferences and performance.<br>


## Conclusion:
The restaurant dataset provides a comprehensive overview of restaurant distribution and preferences across different regions. Key observations include a high concentration of restaurants in India and the USA, with popular cuisines being "North Indian," "Chinese," and "Fast Food." The dataset reveals valuable insights into geographical distribution and preferences, which can inform strategic decisions for market expansion and targeted marketing efforts. The dataset is clean, with minimal missing values, and does not require further data type conversions or balancing, ensuring reliable analysis outcomes.
